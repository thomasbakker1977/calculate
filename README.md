We're in a supermarket and we need to calculate some prices. Naturally we grab our laptop and start writing a Python script. 


1
Create a variable for each of the following items in the supermarket: broccoli, leek, potato and brussel_sprout. Broccoli and leek are 2 euros a piece, a potato is 3 euros and a Brussels sprout will set you back 7 euros. Times are hard.

2
Calculate the total cost if you were to buy one of each -- not by hand, of course, let Python do it! Store this in a variable sum_one_each.

3
Calculate the average price per item and store this in avg_price.

4
Create a variable num_potatoes that indicates we want 7 potatoes. Do the same for:

num_broccolis -- we want 5 of those.
num_leeks -- 2 please.
num_brussel_sprouts -- we'll take 10.

5
Calculate the sum total and store it in a variable aptly named sum_total.

6
Fortunately for us, there's a discount of 30%. Store this in a variable discount_percentage (hint: note the variable name already says 'percent')

7
Calculate the amount owed after the discount is applied, rounded to the nearest cent. Store the result in discounted_sum_total.

8
Print this amount.
